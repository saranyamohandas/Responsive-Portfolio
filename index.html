        <p id="para2"> Apart from technology interest, am a full time and exhausted mom of one year old. My hobby is painting and I am wondering when I would really get hold of a brush again. I love to walk my pet. He is a lab/german sherperd mix and a wonderful companion.  Otherwise a good cook, beware hot and spicy Indian dishes!! I like to be simple. I am trying to be minimalistic these days and clutter-free. </p>
